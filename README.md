## Retail-Inventory-and-sales-Management-system
The Retail Inventory and Management System is a desktop application that is intended to simplify and 
enhance retail operations. It has an easy-to-use interface and allows an administrator to easily manage the 
inventory and produce a sales report all while allowing sales staff to quickly and easily enter sales data. It 
uses a multiuser database, allowing multiple users to work on the application at the same time, with no 
worry of data collision.  
By providing a simple layout to work from, while allowing multiple users at the same time to collaborate, 
ensuring safe and secure data management, the application provides a retail business a reliable and efficient 
solution to its modern-day problems.
the project was developed entirely in a standard Windows 

environment using the suite of tools available from Progress Software Corporation.
the user interface for the app was visually built using Progress 

AppBuilder. AppBuilder is widely used for its Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities. In 
AppBuilder, the developers do not have to deal with the complexities of coding the GUI by hand
