#System Architecture
The Client Tier (User Interface)  
This tier represents the user-facing portion of the application which runs locally on the desktop of end users. 
In this system, the client tier is responsible for the presentation and execution of the business logic. 
• User Interface (User Interface): this part consists of all the visible elements with which users 
will interact: login screens, product maintenance, sales entry, and reports. The UI is 
constructed using a standard set of AppBuilder widgets such as FRAMES, BROWSE tables, FILL
IN fields, and BUTTONS.

The Server Tier (Data Layer)  
This tier is the back end of the system and is responsible for the storage, management, of data within the 
application. 
• Business Logic: The business logic is written in Progress 4GL / OpenEdge ABL (version 12.8), 
and exist as part of the client application within all the screens. When a user selects an action 
(logging in, adding a product, recording a sale, etc...), the ABL code runs directly on the user's 
computer.  
• the system also system utilize a Progress OpenEdge RDBMS database. which is a multi-user database, allowing many client 
applications to connect and perform work at the same time without data corruption.
